# MNIST_GAN

Engineered a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to generate grayscale images of hand-written digits,without using the layers normally used in a Convolutional Neural Network to see how well would an Artificial Neural Network perform in a task better suited for a Convolutional Neural Network.Achieved 35% "Generator",and 17% "Discriminator" accuracy, respectively.
